# Credits and Acknowledgments

This project builds upon the excellent work of the upstream repository:

- Upstream: https://github.com/JohnRTitor/nix-iso

Sincere thanks to the upstream author(s) for their contributions and ideas that inspired and informed this fork. This repository (https://github.com/dwilliam62/nix-iso) adapts and extends that work with a unified recovery toolset across all profiles, additional scripts, and documentation improvements.
